# python-challenge
New GitHub repository for Module 3 Challenge
There are 2 folders, PyBank and PyPoll
In each of these folders, there should be 3 things:
    a main file, called main.py
    a folder to contain CSV files, called Resources
    and a folder to contain the text file(s) containing results, called analysis

Thank you for taking the time to read this README file!
