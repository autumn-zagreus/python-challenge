Hello!

Please find in the accompanying repository folders my submission files for Module 3 Python Challenge.
In the main Python Challenge repository, you should see 5 items:
  -3 folders (PyBank, which contains all the files for the PyBank assignment; PyPoll, which contains all the files for the PyPoll assignment; and Images, which contains relevant images)
  -2 files (this file, README.md; and originalREADME.md, which contains the instructions for this assignment).

In each of the 2 relevant folders, PyBank and PyPoll, you should see 3 items:
  - main.py: this is the Python script file which contains all the code for each assignment in the challenge
  - Resources: this is a folder containing relevant data files
  - an analysis file: either pollAnalysis.txt or budgetAnalysis.txt; these two files contain the outputs for the scripts.

  Thank you for taking the time to read this file.
